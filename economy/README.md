# Economy

Every market in Seasons of Eden is regional, which means that each market has its own character.

Because [resources](resources.md) shift locations as theyâ€™re exhausted, people as a result will tend to move about the world, seeking out the best resources for their [crafting](../crafting.md) builds, and the best markets for their goods.

Some of the things influencing this are:

1. Limited resources.
2. Asymmetrical distribution of said resources \(You may only find a particular material in a particular zone or just a few zones, so when that resource is depleted, the cost can go up drastically.\)
3. Local markets \(No central auction house or warehouse\).
4. Making the best materials only available through crafting.
5. Players being given enough tools to specialize in crafting \(and ideally trading and transportation\) so that it can be seen as a real profession.
